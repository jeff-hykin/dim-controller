// Camera presets: the latency-vs-quality tradeoff, per camera and per viewer, as bridge subscription options
// (zenoh-gateway's video policy: maxResolution, maxBitrate, minResolutionScale, minQuality, qualityToHzTradeoff,
// playoutDelay): the gateway encodes a smaller picture at fewer bits (each frame is fewer packets: on the wire, decoded and
// on screen sooner, and a squeezed link keeps the rate) or the full picture at more bits (dropping frames, not detail, when
// short). playoutDelay is the browser side: the gateway marks each video packet with it, and the receiver may hold frames
// that long to even out their arrival ([0, 0], the default, shows each the moment it decodes).
// A change applies in place (Subscription.update, zenoh-gateway >= 0.5.1): same subscription and track, no gap; leaving
// High quality's buffered playout takes a new subscription instead (core/video.ts needsNewReceiver: Firefox froze).
// The choice is per viewer (a phone on cellular wants low latency, a desktop on the LAN quality): localStorage, not the
// backend's shared settings.
